FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE APP

Whack a letter game was intentionally designed for the teenagers and for the kids who are practicing programming. And also for those who are interested in letter writing and typing. The basic idea behind the whole project was to make people more familiar with the “QWERTY” keyboard which has been used in laptops,computer keyboards and all sort of smart devices since the origin of smart technology and computers.Through whack a mole 2D game, we try to make people more comfortable with the new technology.The game initially increases the speed of identification of a letter and gradually passes it to a point where it increases the speed of typing. 

At the initial level, the user is supposed to identified the randomly generated letter and click on it, with time the speed of dynamicity increases and the key change occurs more often. we have made it more challenging to the player since we are counting the high score and we always motivate the user to beat the current set high score..

The designers hope that they have created a quality game (whack a letter) since the intention of it was not just based on making a player getting addicted on the game but making a player  learn something new from the game.

The game randomly select a tile from 30 tiles in the game user interface and display a random keyboard character from the string “ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ,./;'[]1234567890”. In the first time user have 3000 milliseconds  to input right character and every time a character displayed time gets reduced by 200 milliseconds until the waiting time reaches 600 milliseconds after that point it remains a constant. User can also see the current score and the current high score.
